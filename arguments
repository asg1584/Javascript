// Coders can  not know every possible value. Because of this uncertainty, we try to write most flexible code. Arguments are very good example for that.
// We examine if values smaller than a limit is, we can use arguments to escape from this ambiguity.

    const passedCount = args.filter(arg => arg >= 50).length;
    const failedCount = args.length - passedCount;
