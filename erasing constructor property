/*This statement is explaining a crucial side effect that occurs when you manually set an object's prototype to a new object in JavaScript. 
The side effect is that it erases the constructor property. 
The constructor property is typically used to identify which constructor function created an instance, but when it is overwritten, it can lead to incorrect results.*/

function Bird() {
}
var duck = new Bird();
duck.__proto__ = {
  // New prototype object
};

duck.constructor === Bird; // false
duck.constructor === Object; // true
duck instanceof Bird; // true

// Changing constructed property makes this property like not constructed property
