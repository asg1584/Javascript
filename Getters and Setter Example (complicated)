/*Use the class keyword to create a Thermostat class. The constructor accepts a Fahrenheit temperature.

In the class, create a getter to obtain the temperature in Celsius and a setter to set the temperature in Celsius.

Remember that C = 5/9 * (F - 32) and F = C * 9.0 / 5 + 32, where F is the value of temperature in Fahrenheit, and C is the value of the same temperature in Celsius.

Note: When you implement this, you will track the temperature inside the class in one scale, either Fahrenheit or Celsius.

This is the power of a getter and a setter. You are creating an API for another user, who can get the correct result regardless of which one you track.

In other words, you are abstracting implementation details from the user.*/

// Our mission is coding a Thermostat. It changes different degree type to another. 


class Thermostat {
  constructor(fahrenheitTemperature) {
    this._temperature = fahrenheitTemperature;

// We define the class and temperature value. Please be careful about "_" before "temperature". it is used to show that please do not change this value from outside. It is special.
  get temperature() {
    return (5 / 9) * (this._temperature - 32);
  }
// we write a function and it declares how we get this value which is defined in constructor.
  set temperature(celsiusTemperature) {
    this._temperature = (celsiusTemperature * 9) / 5 + 32;
