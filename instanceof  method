/* Anytime a constructor function creates a new object, that object is said to be an instance of its constructor. 
JavaScript gives a convenient way to verify this with the instanceof operator. 
instanceof allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor.*/

//If an object is created without using a constructor, instanceof will verify that it is not an instance of that constructor:
/*let canary = {
  name: "Mildred",
  color: "Yellow",
  numLegs: 2
};

canary instanceof Bird;
This instanceof method would return false.*/
//Create a new instance of the House constructor, calling it myHouse and passing a number of bedrooms. Then, use instanceof to verify that it is an instance of House.

function House(numBedrooms) {
  this.numBedrooms = numBedrooms;
}

// Only change code below this line

let myHouse = new House(2);

myHouse instanceof House;
