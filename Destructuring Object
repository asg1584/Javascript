//Destructuring assignment is special syntax introduced in ES6, for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.


const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;

//When user write console.log(age), user get "34" as response 

//There is another way for this process. User may write:

const { name, age } = user;

////When user write console.log(name), user get "John Doe" as response 


const diary = { 
    name : "sebastian", 
    surname : "Light",
    age : 22,
    job: "Developer"
};

const {surname, age} = diary;

console.log(surname);
