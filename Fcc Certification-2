/*The user may fill out the form field any way they choose as long as it has the format of a valid US number. 
The following are examples of valid formats for US numbers (refer to the tests below for other variants):

555-555-5555
(555)555-5555
(555) 555-5555
555 555 5555
5555555555
1 555 555 5555
For this challenge you will be presented with a string such as 800-692-7753 or 8oo-six427676;laskdjf. 
Your job is to validate or reject the US phone number based on any combination of the formats provided above. 
The area code is required. If the country code is provided, you must confirm that the country code is 1. 
Return true if the string is a valid US phone number; otherwise return false.*/

function telephoneCheck(str) {
  //  We prepare a number order for phone.
  // It must contain all of the order, which accepts all formats.
  const phoneRegex = /^(1\s?)?(\(\d{3}\)|\d{3})([-\s]?)\d{3}([-|\s]?)\d{4}$/;  
/* (1\s?)?: This is an optional group. It represents the country code for international calls to the U.S., which is "1."
However, this group is optional, as not all phone numbers will have an international code.
\s? checks for the presence of a space character, indicating the optional nature of the country code.
(\(\d{3}\)|\d{3}): This group represents the three-digit area code. It consists of two options: 
It starts with (\(\d{3}\) and includes an opening parenthesis, three digits, and a closing parenthesis, or it continues with \d{3} and includes just three digits. 
This allows for both parentheses-enclosed and unenclosed area codes.

([-\s]?): This group represents an optional separator following the area code. It can be either a hyphen (dash) or a space character, indicated by [-\s]?. 
It's optional, so the separator doesn't have to be present.

\d{3}: This part represents the middle three digits of the phone number. In other words, there must be exactly three digits in the middle section of the phone number.

([-|\s]?): This group represents a separator between the middle three digits and the last four digits. 
Similar to the previous separator, it can be either a hyphen or a space character and is optional.

\d{4}: This part represents the last four digits of the phone number. The phone number's last section must contain exactly four digits.

$: End of string. The regex will attempt to match up to the end of the string.*/

telephoneCheck("555-555-5555");// True
